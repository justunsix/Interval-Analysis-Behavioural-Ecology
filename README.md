# Interval Analysis and its Applications to Optimization in Behavioural Ecology

This directory contains Matlab files for the report below.

## Abstract

Interval Analysis is a means of representing uncertainty by replacing single
(fixed-point) values with intervals. In this project, interval analysis is
applied to a foraging model in behavioural ecology. The model describes an
individual foraging in a collection of continuously renewing resource patches.
This model is used to determine the optimal residence time of the forager in a
resource patch assuming the forager wants to maximize its rate of resource
intake. Before applying interval analysis, fixed-point (non-interval)
optimization will be done to serve as a basis. Certain parameters in the model
will then be replaced with intervals and interval-based optimization conducted.
A comparison of the interval and fixed-point results will be done as well as
analysis of parameter intervals and their constraints, root approximations, and
applications to the model.

### Chapter 1: Introduction

#### 1.1 Interval Analysis

##### 1.1.1 Basics and Notation

This paper will explain only the basics of **Interval Analysis** (IA) needed to
understand the topics covered and assumes some prior knowledge of IA and Matlab
(see 2.1.4 regarding Matlab). For a formal mathematical introduction and in
depth coverage of concepts see Schwartz (1999) or Moore (1966) listed in the
references. Interval analysis was initially developed in the late 1960's to
bound computational error and it is a deterministic way of representing
uncertainty in values by replacing a number with a range of values (Schwartz
17). Fixed-point analysis is simply analysis using non-interval values where
there is no uncertainty in the values. As a result, IA uncertainty concepts can
be used to model varying biological parameters in the ecological model to be
explored in section 1.2 and also to frame fixed-point results.

IA's mathematical definitions and notations are extended from set theory and
ordered numerical sets called intervals (Schwartz 30). This paper considers
closed interval analysis with the following definitions of an **interval**
(using Matlab upper bound, lower bound style notation):

![](media/clip_image004.png)

inf(x) -- denotes the infinum, or lower bound of **x**

sup(x) -- denotes the supremum or upper bound of **x**

##### 1.1.2 Uncertainty and Approximating Values\*\*

There are a several useful quantities related to the concept of the interval:
size, radius, and midpoint. The size (or thickness) of an interval indicates the
uncertainty in a value and is specified as a width: w(**x**) = sup**(x) -**
inf(**x**) (Schwartz 32-33). Intervals with zero thickness are crisp intervals
whereas non-crisp intervals said to be thick. The concepts of radius and
midpoint are useful in describing intervals as well as constructing them. The
radius and midpoint are defined as (Schwartz 33):

```txt
rad(x) = w(x)/2

mid(x) = (sup(x) + inf(x))/2
```

To construct a new interval, one way is to use an original value, which is a
value that supplies the midpoint point of a new interval. Then, a certain radius
(uncertainty) can be added to and subtracted from the original value to obtain a
new interval (Schwartz 35). Similarly, the midpoint can also serve as an
approximation to a value with an error of plus or minus the radius. Using these
definitions, the percentage uncertainty in a midpoint value would be: p =
100\*rad(**x**)/mid(**x**) (Schwartz 148).

##### 1.1.3 Interval Arithmetic and Functions

The results and properties of interval arithmetic will be omitted for this
section; however, I recommend referring to Schwartz (1999) to understand the
basics of interval arithmetic. The fundamental principles in interval operations
are independence and extremes. Independence means numerical values vary
independently between intervals and extremes means interval operations generate
the widest possible bounds given the ranges of values (Schwartz 37-38).
Interval-valued functions follow from interval arithmetic of which there are two
types: interval extensions and united extensions (or true solution sets).
Interval extensions are functions where interval arithmetic is applied to
calculate results. United extensions are more computationally intensive and
involve calculating fixed-point results with all possible combinations of
variable interval endpoints. The disadvantage of the interval extensions is that
they can over expand the true solution sets of a function (Schwartz 45-49). This
quality of interval extensions is unfortunate since both types of extensions
guarantee containment of all possible numerical results of the function given
the inputs. Also, both extensions satisfy a property called inclusion
monotonicity (given inputs, an extension generates the widest possible bounds),
which is similar to the extremes principle of interval arithmetic (Schwartz 56).

#### 1.2 Foraging Theory

##### 1.2.1 Basics of Foraging Models

Foraging models in general study two basic problems of a forager: which
food/prey items to consume and when to leave an area containing food (a resource
patch). This paper will concentrate on the latter as an optimization problem.
Before going into details of the model, it is important to understand the
framework of foraging models. Stephens and Krebs point out that foraging and
optimality models have three main components, decision, currency, and constraint
assumptions (5). Decision assumptions determine which problems (or choices) of
the forager are to be analyzed and these choices are usually expressed as
variables. The optimization problem comes from assuming behaviour and
evolutionary mechanisms optimize the outcome of a forager's choices. Currency
assumptions provide means of evaluating choices. These choices usually involve
maximization, minimization, or stability of a situation. Choice evaluation is
embodied in the currency function (a real valued function), which takes the
decision variables and evaluates their outcome into a single value. Constraint
assumptions are limitations to the model and relate decision variables with the
currency. Limitations can be generalized to 2 types, extrinsic (environment
limits on animal) and intrinsic (animal's own limitations). Also, there are
three general constraint assumptions (also assumed by the model in section
1.2.2) for conventional foraging models:

1. Exclusivity of search and exploitation -- the predator can only consume or
   search for patches/prey and not perform both actions are the same time

2. Sequential Poisson encounters -- items (prey or patches) are encountered one
   at a time and there is a constant probability regarding prey/patch meetings
   in a short time period

3. Complete information -- the forager behaves as if it knows the rules of the
   model

These three concepts of decision, currency, and constraint provide means of
optimization given choices, how to determine their success, and limitations
(Stephens and Krebs 6-11).

##### 1.2.2 Simplistic Analytic Foraging Model

Given the structure of a foraging model, it is easy to frame a model examining
the foraging of a single animal over a collection of distinct resource patches.
I have taken the model along with its decision, currency, and constraint
assumptions from Wilson (2000) so derivations of the model's equations, its
origins, and an analysis and extensions of the model in C can be found in his
book. The rules of the forager in the model are that the animal stays for a
fixed time before moving to a new resource patch, time is discrete, and patch
resource values (biomass, energy, etc) grow logistically. The decision
assumption lies in the determination of the fixed time value. The currency
function allows us to optimize the animal's situation given this fixed time and
also allows us to apply constraints to the model (Wilson 152). Despite its name,
the simplistic analytic foraging model actually characterizes foraging
simulation results well using the model's specifications. Here is a list of
parameters taken in by the model:

![](media/clip_image007.png)

To derive the model, we can start analyzing the resource side assuming that the
ith patch without the forager consuming grows logistically:

![](media/clip_image009.png)

Where t is time and r~i~ is the amount of resources in the ith patch. If a
forager enters a given patch f, resource dynamics can be modeled as follows:

![](media/clip_image011.png)

In the fth patch, the consumer decreases the rate of growth by a factor related
to beta, the consuming rate. To model overall patch growth, average patch growth
for N-1 identical patches is added to the patch growth (or decay) of the fth
patch:

![](media/clip_image013.png)

![](media/clip_image015.png)

To achieve an equilibrium resource density r\*, we set dr/dt = 0 and solve for r
yielding:

![](media/clip_image017.png)

A quick analysis of the limit as N approaches infinity shows that the forager's
effect is insignificant at equilibrium since the term containing beta goes to
zero and r*goes to K as expected (Wilson 153-154). The resource side provides us
with an environment and extrinsic constraints that will affect the currency
function which lies on the forager side of the model. Key to resource
exploitation models is the gain function, g(t). The gain function specifies the
amount consumed from a resource patch given time t. Assuming the forager lands
on a resource patch always in equilibrium r*, g(t) is the time integral of its
instantaneous consumption rate minus its metabolic costs. Metabolic costs
represent intrinsic constraints since the animal must "pay" these costs when
foraging.

![](media/clip_image019.png)

The x~t~ and x~m~ constraints act as intrinsic limitations on the model since
the traveling costs prevents the forager from moving quickly from patch to patch
and skimming resources, while the metabolic cost causes the forager to gather
resources for threat of death. In order to evaluate g(t), we require an
analytical solution to r~f~, which measures the resources in the patch the
forager is in. Solving the first order differential equation from the resource
side derivations for r~f~ using separation of variables yields:

![](media/clip_image021.png)

Then substituting this equation into g(t) and solving the integral we get:

![](media/clip_image023.png)

Using this gain function, the crucial equation from the forager perspective, the
net foraging rate function can be calculated as:

![](media/clip_image025.png)

R(t) is the currency function for our model since it is the basis of choice
evaluation and optimization for the model (Wilson 154-155). It also combines the
decision variables and constraints into one value and will be a basis for
graphical analysis later on.

##### 1.2.3 The Optimal Residence Time

Assuming behavioural and evolutionary mechanisms drive foragers to optimize the
time spent on each patch. This assumption implies that they will stay long
enough to optimize the rate of resource consumption, r(t). Mathematically, this
choice implies the maximization of r(t):

![](media/clip_image027.png)

where t*is called the optimal residence time. For rate maximization, r''(t*) < 0
must also be checked; however, assuming r(t\*) is at a maximum, we obtain the
equation:

![](media/clip_image029.png)

which relates r(t) to the derivative of the gain function. The second function
above is the function to be used for root finding. Essentially, the optimal time
to leave a patch is when the expected rate of resource return decreases to the
average rate of return of a new patch. This result, which is a statement of the
marginal value theorem for foraging, is a reasonable estimation of animal
behaviour considering a forager's desire to maximize on its resource intake
(Wilson 156-157). One problem in optimization problems is figuring out whether
an optimal point exists and in this case, we must be sure r''(t*) < 0 and be
sure such a t* exists. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of g(t) is it not
possible to solve for an explicit solution of t*so to justify existence of a
solution, we turn to theoretical justifications and, later in section 3.1.1,
graphical means. Due to the conditions specified in foraging models, gain
functions are "well-defined, continuous, deterministic, and negatively
accelerated" functions (Stephens and Krebs 25-26). This outcome results from
assuming patch resources are sufficient (i.e. the equilibrium resource is
sufficiently large) enough that, when the forager enters a patch, r(t) will
reach a maximum and then decrease until the gain function reaches an asymptotic
maximum when further time spent in the resource patch does not yield
significantly more gain in resources. The reason for the gain function's
properties is the assumption that patches contain a finite number of resources
and foraging depletes them. This assumption; however, relies on the assumptions
about residence time, foraging rates, and resource patch dynamics in general
(Stephens and Krebs 25-26). Due to the simple nature of the model, these gain
function properties hold so r(t) does reach a maximum at t* and r''(\*t) < 0.

### Chapter 2: Research Problems and Methods

#### 2.1 Motivation

##### 2.1.1 Problems with Fixed Point Optimization in Foraging Models

Stephens and Krebs (1986) discuss various limitations and criticisms of
behavioural ecology optimality models. One criticism has to do with "static
versus dynamic" modeling since basic foraging models often do not take the
animal's state into account (i.e. whether an animal is starving or fully rested
and fed) (Stephens and Krebs 34). Also, a problem that occurs during testing
phases of a model is when it breaks down. At that point, the ecologist must
re-analyze the model to find what is incorrect, often checking constraints
(Stephens and Krebs 208)

##### 2.1.2 Interval Analysis as an Uncertainty Method

IA can address but not completely solve the problems stated above. One of the
strengths of IA is its ability to evaluate a whole range of values in one
calculation that would take an infinite number of fixed-point calculations to
produce. As a result, IA could simulate the presence of multiple states of an
animal and/or its environment by placing uncertainty in the model's parameters.
This method provides easy deterministic implementation of multiple state models
and produces ranges of values for evaluation. This method partially addresses
the second problem of when a model breaks down. A model could break down due to
incorrect assumptions about constant forager or environment states. Another
application of IA to testing is that IA is numerically superior when it comes to
testing different acceptable uncertainties in values could help identify
problems in the model or unrealistic assumptions.

##### 2.1.3 Research Problem

The purpose of this paper is to introduce IA methods to the simplistic analytic
foraging model and calculate interval optimal residence times for interval
parameters. At same time, solving the fixed point optimal residence time will
provide framework from which to analyze the interval results. The optimization
will be done for patch sizes N = 3, 5, 10, and 20. The parameters with
uncertainty will be:

![](media/clip_image031.png)

These uncertainties could be strengthened with fieldwork studies; however, for
simplicity they are determined a priori. After computing interval optimal
residence times, the intervals and their fixed-point approximations will be
compared to the fixed-point optimal times to compare algorithms and to analyze
the functions' behaviour under both methods. On a more theoretical side,
stability analysis of the model will be conducted. This analysis involves
varying one uncertain parameter, while holding the others constant until the
model fails. Therefore, stability analysis is used to see performance of the
model under parameter uncertainty perturbations. Conditions for failure will be
specified in section 2.2.2.3.

##### 2.1.4 Software

The language to be used is Matlab version 5.3 with an add-on toolbox called
INTLAB programmed by Siegfried Rump (2001). Refer to the references for
documentation on the INTLAB toolbox. For this paper, the INTLAB toolbox is used
to provide interval data structures, implementation of interval arithmetic and
interval-valued functions, as well as basic functions for radius, midpoint, and
intersection interval functions in Matlab.

##### 2.2 Methodology

![](media/clip_image032.png)

##### 2.2.1 Fixed-Point Analysis

###### 2.2.1.1 General Method

Rootfunc(t) specified below is the function whose root we are seeking:

![](media/clip_image034.png)

Since rootfunc(t) has relatively cheap function evaluations it is useful to
perform a "graphical search" for the root (Van Loan 294). This procedure
involves plotting the function in the time interval of interest and examining
its roots. In addition to this function, during the fixed-point analysis, we
will also plot r(t) to search for the existence of maximums as well as
rootfunc''(t) to confirm that rootfunc''(t) is indeed negative in the interval
of interest. Although, graphical searches are rather trivial, they provide a
large amount of information confirming theoretical conclusions in section 1.2 as
well as enabling a pictorial view of the objective and related functions.
Another use of the plotting of functions before optimization is to use the plots
to generate starting intervals for iterations of root finding methods. In order
to plot rootfunc, r(t), and r''(t) it is necessary to implement equations for
g(t), g'(t), and r''(t). The details for calculating g'(t) and r''(t) are left
out since g(t) is a rather messy function, but the derivatives are implemented
in the Matlab code for section 3.1.1. Assuming the properties of the gain
function discussed in 1.2.3, which will be confirmed in section 3.1.1, it is
necessary to choose an algorithm that will produce a root given the conditions
of rootfunc(t).

###### 2.2.1.2 Algorithm: Bisection Method

Since rootfunc(t) is continuous and changes sign within the interval of
interest, the bisection method can be used. This method involves calculating a
sequence of smaller and smaller intervals that bracket (contain) the root of
rootfunc(t). The main algorithm proceeds as follows (if rootfunct(t) = f(t))
given a bracketing interval [a,b]:

assume f(a)f(b) ![](media/clip_image036.png)0 and let m = (a+b)/2

either f(a)f(m) ![](media/clip_image036.png)0 or f(m)f(b)
![](media/clip_image036.png)0

in the first case we know the root is in [a,m] else it is it [m,b]

In either situation, the search interval is halved and this process can be
continued until a small enough interval is obtained. Since the search interval
is halved with each iteration, the bisection method exhibits O(n) convergence.
The only tricky points are to optimize the method so that only one function
evaluation is required per iteration after the first and to establish a safe
convergence criterion so that the tolerance interval is not smaller than the gap
in the floating point numbers between a and b. Van Loan provides the core of the
code for the bisection method with slight modifications to fit the parameters of
the model (280). Although the bisection method does not experience O(n^2)
convergence like the Newton method, rootfunc(t) is simple enough that it
converges quickly for practical purposes. Also, it is simple (algorithmically
and doesn't require rootfunc'(t) implementation) and translates well into the
idea of searching using a starting interval [a,b], which we will use later in
the interval root finding.

##### 2.2.2 Interval Analysis

###### 2.2.2.1 General Method

When changing from fixed-point to interval based root finding there are some
immediate differences. The root is no longer a crisp interval since iterations
using an interval-valued function produce intervals. As a result, convergence
criterions and the general methods of root finding must have a set valued
approach. Because the optimal residence times will inherently be thick intervals
since the rootfunc(**t**) is now an interval function with uncertain parameters,
convergence will be solved simple by setting a maximum number of iterations. The
reason this convergence guarantees an enclosure of the root is due to the
Interval Newton method, which is based on the fixed-point one.

###### 2.2.2.2 Interval Newton Method

For details of the math and convergence properties of the algorithm, refer to
Kulisch et al. (2001). This algorithm, when finding roots of fixed-point
functions exhibits O(n^2) convergence. Like the Bisection Method, it requires a
bracketing interval to begin and with each iteration generates smaller and
smaller intervals (if possible), which are bounded by intersections with
previous iterations. The algorithm is as follows:

![](media/clip_image038.png)

where the **x**'s are intervals, m(**x**) is the midpoint of a the interval
**x,** and f is the function whose root we seek (Kulisch et al. 35-36). The
similarity of this algorithm to the fixed-point Newton method is that a starting
interval must be supplied and the interval size is decreased using a
f(**x**)/f'(**x**) term during iterations. This algorithm is almost as simple as
the bisection method since an easy convergence criterion has been specified;
however, the interval Newton requires implementation of rootfunc'(t) and
requires ![root function of x](media/clip_image040.png) for an evaluated
interval **x**. Through computational trials, I have decided to increase the
complexity of the function evaluations for the f(**x**)/f'(**x**) by computing
its united extension instead of a interval extension. Since both f(**x**) and
f'(**x**) involve many interval arithmetic calculations in an interval
extension, the values are over expanded from their true solution set and in
computing optimal residence times we are interested in finding tight bounds on
the root given model uncertainties. As a result, the interval Newton step is
calculated by finding the minimums and maximums of f(**x**) and f'(**x**) given
all the combinations of the endpoints of the parameters and the time interval
and producing united extension values for both quantities.

###### 2.2.2.3 Variation and Constraints on Parameters

As outlined in 2.1.3, percent uncertainties in the alpha, beta, x~t~, and x~m~
parameters will be added when analyzing the model using interval root finding.
This variation of parameters serves to address the problems with fixed-point
optimization outlined in 2.1.1. The potential use for interval parameters lies
in model testing, simulating a range of environment and forager states, and
relaxation of constraints. Besides replacing parameters with intervals, we also
want to conduct the stability analysis mentioned in 2.1.3. This process involves
increasing uncertainties of a given parameter while keeping all other parameters
constant until the model fails. After specifying the interval Newton algorithm
we can construct a failure condition. Failure of the model can be considered to
occur when the interval Newton method returns of the initial interval supplied
to the interval root finder as the optimal time interval for any N number of
patches (i.e. the algorithm was unable to provide tighter bounds for optimal
residence time than the initial interval). This initial interval will be chosen
to be a sufficiently thick interval from fixed-point analysis, which encloses
the time interval of interest. As a result, the interval will be the one chosen
to initiate the bisection method. There are other conditions that could classify
failure; however, from a model standpoint, a very thick interval for an optimal
residence time is not very useful since it implies too much variability in a
forager's behaviour. Consequently, stability analysis is a numerically intensive
procedure involving gradual increased uncertainties of a parameter until model
failure. It is interesting more from a theoretical standpoint since it describes
limitations of the model as well as extreme situations and their effects on a
forager's optimal residence time.

### Chapter 3: Numerical Analysis of Model

In this chapter, I will include Matlab code of key functions implementing the
general methods discussed in 2.2, supporting functions, and algorithms as they
are used in the numerical analysis of the model.

#### 3.1 Fixed-Point Analysis

##### 3.1.1 Graphical Analysis

In section 2.2.1.1, the graphs of r(t), rootfunc(t) and rootfunc'(t) were seen
to be informative for selecting an initial interval to begin the bisection and
interval Newton methods. Also, these graphs help visualize the behaviour of the
model as time passes as well as confirming an optimal residence time exists. The
following functions are required to implement the functions and graph them.
Also, the following parameter specifications from Wilson are used (155):

This last function produces two plots that can be used for graphical analysis
(shown on next page). One shows the intake rate as a function of time for N = 3,
5, 10, and 20 resources patches. From the first graph, we can confirm that r(t),
for different values of N, does indeed have a maximum and the downward sloping
nature after the maximum confirms the negative acceleration of the gain function
as time passes. The second graph is informative in showing rootfunc(t) and
provides an interval of [4, 16] where all the roots of the function are
contained for the different N. An additional plot of rootfunc'(t) (although not
labeled but are shown as upward sloping curves below the root function) ensures
that the interval Newton root finding algorithm will work since not only is
rootfunc'(t) < 0, but ![](media/clip_image044.png) and it turns out that further
plotting shows that rootfunc'(t) does not assume a 0 until much later (around t
= 40) for t > 0 and different N values.

##### 3.1.2 Optimization and Analysis

With information from the previous section, we can now proceed to fixed-point
and interval root finding with confidence that rootfunc(t) is well behaved for
the chosen algorithms and that optimal residence times exist. The following code
implements the bisection method by Van Loan and fixed-point root finding which
uses the same parameter specifications as in the graphical analysis (280-281).

```matlab
function root = Bisection(a, b, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N)

% BISECTION(a, b) Bisection Root Finder

%

% Algorithm based on Bisection method by Van Loan (pg. 281)

% a and b define a bracketing interval that contains a root

% of the function rootfunc while other parameters are passed

% into rootfunc

%

% Convergence is set so that tolerance is never smaller than

% than the spacing between the floating point numbers a and b

fa = rootfunc(a, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N);

fb = rootfunc(b, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N);

delta = 1/500000;

if fa*fb > 0

 disp('Initial interval is not bracketing.')

 disp('Please choose another interval or check function')

 root = 'Invalid Root';

else

while abs(a-b) > delta+eps*max(abs(a),abs(b))

  mid = (a+b)/2;

  fmid = rootfunc(mid, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N);

  if fa*fmid<=0

  % There is a root in [a,mid].

  b = mid;

     fb = fmid;

  else

     % There is a root in [mid,b].

  a = mid;

  fa = fmid;

  end

 end

 root = (a+b)/2;

end

function fpoptimize = fpoptimize()

N = [3 5 10 20];

for j = N

 roots(i) = Bisection(a, b, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, j);

 i = i + 1;

end

disp('Resource Patches Optimal Residence Time')

disp('========================================')

for i = 1:4

 disp(sprintf(' %2.0f    %5.10f', N(i), roots(i)))

end
```

```txt
The last function provides us with the following output:

This table of results and can combined with the graphical analysis to produce a
graph of the intake function and a spline interpolated plot of optimal residence
times t*'s and r(*t)'s for different N.

```matlab

N = [3 5 10 20];

for i = 1:4

 roots(i) = Bisection(4, 16, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N(i));

 ft(i) = r(roots(i), alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N(i));

end

maxt = linspace(roots(1), roots(4)-2);

maxr = spline(roots, ft, maxt);

plot(t,w,'-',t,x,':',t,y,'-.',t,z,'--',maxt,maxr);

xlabel('Residence Time'); ylabel('Intake Rate')

legend('N = 3','N = 5','N = 10','N = 20','Optimal Residence Times');
```

This graphical result represents a holistic view of the fixed-point optimization
of the r(t) function. In the graph, we see the optimal residence time curve,
which illustrates the marginal value theorem since the interpolant intersects
the r(t) functions at their maximums. We can use this interpolant to estimate
optimal residence times for N > 20 and visualize how these times vary with N.
The relation is that as N increases from 3 the optimal residence time in a patch
decreases. This result makes sense from the model since more patches imply
higher average intake rates and therefore but the marginal value theorem, a
forager will tend to move to different patches more quickly to optimize its
resource consumption. When looking at results in the next section on IA, we
should take with us the fixed-point optimal times as well as the bisection
method's initializing interval of [4,16] which can be used to initiate the
interval Newton method.

#### 3.2 Interval Analysis

##### 3.2.1 True Solutions and Interval Optimization

During the interval optimization, we will simulate fixed-point optimization
first using crisp intervals for the parameters and then conduct interval
optimization by varying the parameters as outlined in section 2.1.3 to obtain
interval optimal residence times. The following is code implementing the
creation of a new interval data structure, the interval Newton algorithm, and
the united extension Newton step.

```matlab
function newInterval = newInterval(c, p)

% NEWINTERVAL Interval creator

%

% Creates a new interval given a centerpoint c and

% a percentage uncertainty p

p_uncert = p/100;

inf = c -- p_uncert*absI;

sup = c + p_uncert*absI;

newInterval = infsup(inf, sup);

function root = intNewton(x, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N, nEvalsMax)

% INTNEWTON(a, b) Interval Root Finder

%

% Algorithm based on Interval Newton method by Kulisch (pg. 35-37)

% x defines a bracketing interval that contains a root

% of the function rootfunc while other parameters are passed

% into rootfunc

%

% Convergence based on nvalsMax (maximum number of iterations)

% since we do not know the optimal residence interval size

fx = rootfunc(x, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N);

if 0 < inf(fx) | 0 > sup(fx)

 disp('Initial interval is not bracketing.')

 disp('Please choose another interval or check function')

 root = 'Invalid Root';

else

 I = 0;

 while I < nEvalsMax

 x = UnitedNewtonStep(x, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N);

 I = I + 1;

 end

 root = x;

end

function x = UnitedNewtonStep(x, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N)

% UNITEDNEWTONSTEP United Extension implementation of Newton Step

% Since we have 5 variables that are intervals, there will be

% 32 combinations of interval endpoints to compute for

% the derivative quantity and 16 combinations for the

% function quantity (16 because xmid is a crisp interval)

midx = mid(x);

% Various endpoints

a = inf(x);  b = sup(x);

c = inf(alpha); d = sup(alpha);

e = inf(beta);  f = sup(beta);

g = inf(xt);  h = sup(xt);

I = inf(xm);  j = sup(xm);

num = zeros(16,1); denom = zeros(25,1);

I = 1;

j = 1;

for alpha = [c d]

 for beta = [e f]

 for xt = [g h]

 for xm = [I j]

 num(i) = rootfunc(midx, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N);

 I = I + 1;

 for xval = [a b]

 denom(j) = rootprime(xval, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N);

 j = j + 1;

 end

 end

    end

 end

end

unitedNum = infsup(min(num), max(num));

unitedDenom = infsup(min(denom), max(denom));

comp = midx -- unitedNum/unitedDenom;

x = intersect(comp, x);

function intoptimize = intoptimize()

% INTOPTIMIZE Root finding for Interval function

%

% Finds the optimal residence interval for different

% numbers of resource patches N = 3, 5, 10, 20

% using the Interval Newton Method

% Parameter settings

alpha = newInterval(0.05, 0); beta = newInterval(0.1, 0);

xt = newInterval(0.1, 0); xm = newInterval(0.01, 0);

K = 1;

% Search interval

searchInt = infsup(4, 16);

N = [3 5 10 20];

roots = cell(4,1); I = 1;

for I = 1:4

 roots{I} = intNewton(searchInt, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N(i), 100);

end

disp('Resource Optimal Residence Time F-P Approx')

disp(' Patches')

disp('========================================================')

for I = 1:4

 a = inf(roots{I}); b = sup(roots{I});

 midab = mid(roots{I});

 disp(sprintf([' %2.0f [%2.10f, %2.10f]' ...

 ' %2.10f'],N(i),a,b,midab))

end
```

The last function with zero uncertainty in the parameters produces the following
results:

```txt
Resource  Optimal Residence Time   F-P Approx

 Patches

 3  [12.9525651169, 12.9525651169]  12.9525651169

 20  [6.2008119626, 6.2008119626]  6.2008119626
```

Given the following parameter uncertainties:

![](media/clip_image051.png)

and a change in the starting interval to [2,20], using the intoptimize function
the results are:

```txt
Resource  Optimal Residence Time     F-P Approx

 20  [2.6720528558, 9.6782749976]  6.1751639267
```

The significance of these results will be explored in chapter 4.

##### 3.2.2 Stability Analysis

The stability analysis for this model was conducted by gradually increasing the
percentage uncertainties from zero. Failure of the model occurs if one of the
roots returned during optimization is found to be the same interval as the
initial interval [4, 16]. The code implementing stability analysis is not
generalized to any parameter, so user changes are made to select the correct
variable and initial condition. The code displayed shows stability analysis for
alpha. Through testing to speed up the stability analysis, the conditions of
increments of two to the percentage uncertainty of a parameter after five Newton
iterations are sufficient to produce accurate uncertainties where the model
fails.

```matlab
function sa = sa()

% SA Stability Analysis

%

% Finds the optimal residence interval for different

% numbers of resource patches N = 3, 5, 10, 20

% using the Interval Newton Method

% Conducts gradual increase in uncertainty of a given

% parameter until at least of the roots returned is the

% initial interval with 5 Newton iterations

% Parameter settings

alpha = newInterval(0.05, 0); beta = newInterval(0.1, 0);

xt = newInterval(0.1, 0); xm = newInterval(0.01, 0);

K = 1;

% Search interval

searchInt = infsup(4, 16);

N = [3 5 10 20];

p = 0; inc = 2; stop = 0;

while stop ~= 1

 % Choose parameter to increment percent uncertainty

 p = p + inc;

 alpha = newInterval(0.05, p);

 for i = 1:4

 root = intNewton(searchInt, alpha, K, beta, xt, xm, N(i), 5);

 size = sup(root) - inf(root);

 if size == 12

 stop = 1;

 Nstop = N(i);

 end

 end

end

a = inf(alpha); b = sup(alpha);

disp(sprintf('Model Failure at N = %2.0f', Nstop))

disp(sprintf('For parameter alpha with value [%5.7f, %5.7f]',a,b))

disp(sprintf('with percentage uncertainty: %3.0f',p));
```

The results for the 4 parameters are:

```txt
Model Failure at N = 5

For parameter alpha with value [0.0280000, 0.0720000]

with percentage uncertainty: 44

Model Failure at N = 5

For parameter beta with value [0.0620000, 0.1380000]

with percentage uncertainty: 38

Model Failure at N = 5

For parameter xt with value [0.0440000, 0.1560000]

with percentage uncertainty: 56
```

I was not able to find a percent uncertainty for xm that caused the model to
fail even using different starting p values and small increments. However, the
other parameters yielded failures at quite high percentages.

### Chapter 4: Conclusions and Future Exploration

#### 4.1 Results of Numerical Study

##### 4.3.1 Comparison of Fixed-Point and Interval Roots

The values obtained from both optimization methods corresponded well since there
was only O(10^-6) error between the results. This error bound was derived from
the error between the fixed-point roots and the endpoints of the optimal
residence time intervals and the error can also be seen since the interval
approximations and fixed-point roots correspond up to the 5^th^ decimal place.
Therefore, simulating fixed-point optimization using interval techniques yielded
a satisfactory approximation.

##### 4.2.3 Applications to Foraging Model

This section can be considered as conclusions to the research problem as well as
the overall implications of IA to the simplistic analytic foraging model. The
use of IA to simulate different parameter states into the system was successful
since the percent uncertainties yielded interval optimal residence times. As a
result, IA allows the ecologist to vary parameters of the model within certain
limitations established by stability analysis and obtain a range of optimal
residence times a forager might choose. The percent uncertainty limitations on
parameter variation obtained from the stability analysis are high, which is good
since it allows a large amount of model variability. However, we should keep in
mind the stability analysis was made varying one variable at a time. Repeating
the results from section 3.2.1, this time with percent uncertainties matching
the fixed-point approximations, we obtain:

Resource Optimal Residence Time F-P Approx Percent

```txt
 Patches Uncertainty

====================================================

 3      [11.0019636898, 16.3308126324]  13.6663881611  19.49619

 5      [6.5135558910, 10.9632700610]  8.7384129760  25.46065

 10      [3.3884949151, 10.1319917480]  6.7602433315  49.87614

 20      [2.6720528558, 9.6782749976]  6.1751639267  56.72904
```

which provide us with just a sample of IA's capabilities in analyzing the model.
IA's applications to the foraging model include adding more realism to the model
through deterministic variability as well as allowing the ecologist to select
which parameters are to be uncertain, their range, or different beginning time
intervals. The variability is important due to the sometimes stochastic nature
of ecological process and IA offers an alternative to average state
approximations. As stated by Stephen and Krebs, foraging models sometimes run
into problems when assuming constant animal metabolic rates or equilibrium
resources (34). Therefore, IA allows the model to address some of the problems
involved in fixed-point optimization and have the potential to provide a
characterization of experimental values for residence times by bounding them.

#### 4.2 Future Exploration

The applications of increased testability, parameter variation, and interval
optimization provided by IA to our foraging model can easily be applied to other
deterministic models in behavioural ecology. This fact is especially true for
optimality models where average values do not approximate well the range of
states taken on by the environment or animal. Also, although not covered in this
paper, IA has applications to multivariable global optimization due to it's
strength in evaluating multiple ranges of values which can be applied in a
Newton like algorithm (see Hansen in references). An immediate extension of the
work done on this paper involves Wilson's Forager Simulation Model and
extensions for multi foragers (161, 178). The two models are simulations through
time of foragers consuming resources in a set of patches and involve a bit more
forager/patch dynamic analysis and integration of additional foragers into the
model.
